# Encryption-Decryption-tool
I have developed an Encryption and Decryption tool using Python and the AES algorithm. This tool is 
designed to securely handle confidential files by allowing users to encrypt and decrypt them. 
 Encryption: To encrypt a file, the user provides the file path and a key. The tool then encrypts the file 
using the provided key, ensuring that the contents remain confidential. 
 Decryption: To decrypt a file, the user provides the path of the encrypted file and the corresponding 
key. If the key matches the one used for encryption, the file will be decrypted. If the key is incorrect, 
the file will not be decrypted. 
This tool leverage the AES algorithm to ensure robust encryption and decryption processes, safeguarding 
sensitive information from unauthorized access.
